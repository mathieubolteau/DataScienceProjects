# Personal Data Science Projects

Here, I present my personal projects on Data Science, using machine and deep learning techniques.

## :ribbon: Breast Cancer Prediction

This project has for objective to predict breast cancer from cell nuclei characteristics. Here, we train RandonForest, SVMs, SGD and K-Neighbors classifier, as well as a deep neural network. 

Please refer to [Breast Cancer Prediction folder](./breast_cancer_prediction) to observe the project.
